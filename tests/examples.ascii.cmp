dogs
farsightsecurity
foobarbaz
foo
fsizn
fsi

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Example 1: look for original keys
found foo (leaf = foo)
found bar (leaf = bar)
found baz (leaf = baz)
found brad (leaf = brad)
found brady (leaf = brady)
found foobarbaz (leaf = foobarbaz)
found farsightsecurity (leaf = farsightsecurity)
found sigh (leaf = sigh)
found fsi (leaf = fsi)
found fsizn (leaf = fsizn)
found love (leaf = love)
found hate (leaf = hate)
found dogs (leaf = dogs)
found xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (leaf = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

Example 2: look for search terms with partial matches
found brad (leaf = brad)
found baz (leaf = baz)
found foobarbaz (leaf = foobarbaz)
found farsightsecurity (leaf = farsightsecurity)
found fsi (leaf = fsi)
found love (leaf = love)
found lo (leaf = (null))
found dog (leaf = (null))
found d (leaf = (null))
found f (leaf = (null))
